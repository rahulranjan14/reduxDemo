# Redux Simple Implementation

This project is a simple application built using React, state-management implmeneted using Redux, providing a straightforward implementation of Redux concepts.

## Project Overview

The application comprises a single-page interface featuring three main components:

1. **Items Section**: This section showcases a list of items, each having buttons for adding them to either the cart or wishlist.

2. **Cart Section**: Here, users can view items added to their cart. Each item comes with an option to remove it from the cart if needed and an option to clear the entire cart.

3. **Wishlist Section**: Similar to the cart section, users can see items they've added to their wishlist. Items in the wishlist can also be removed individually.

The state management and logic for moving items between the cart and wishlist are implemented using Redux and React-Redux.

## Getting Started

To explore this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Launch the development server using `npm start`.
4. Visit the prompted port in your browser to view the application.

## Additional Task

If you're eager to explore Redux further or enhance your skills, consider adding new features to this project. One such idea is to implement a "Save for Later" section, where users can move items to save them for later. You can refer to the existing "wishlist" and "cart" modules to build this section, leveraging similar functionality and patterns. This hands-on approach offers an opportunity for practical learning and a deeper understanding of Redux concepts in action.

## Project Comparison

This same project with the same functionalities has been implemented using other state management libraries:

- [Redux Toolkit Version](https://github.com/rahulranjan14/reduxToolKitDemo)
- [Recoil Version](https://github.com/rahulranjan14/recoilDemo)
- [Zustand Version](https://github.com/rahulranjan14/zustandDemo)

Comparing all four implementations can help in understanding the differences and implemtation of each library.
